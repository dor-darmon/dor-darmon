##  Featured Projects

###  [AI-detective]((https://github.com/dor-darmon/AI-detective))
> An R&D forensic tool designed to validate identity document integrity using Computer Vision, AI detection, and Digital Forensics.

**Tech:** Python, OpenCV, Streamlit, NumPy, Pandas, SQLite3, FFT  
**Highlights:**
- **AI & Deepfake Detection:** Uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis to detect GAN/Diffusion model artifacts in the frequency domain.
- **Digital Forensics (ELA):** Implements Error Level Analysis to flag manual alterations (e.g., Photoshop) via compression inconsistencies.
- **Automated Quality Control:** Calculates Laplacian Variance for blur detection and validates checksum logic (Luhn Algorithm).
- **Analytics Dashboard:** SQL-backed batch processing system with statistical visualizations (Seaborn/Matplotlib).

###  [Dual-Chain Sentinel | BTC & ETH Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/dor-darmon/SentinelFlow)
> A unified real-time surveillance system for Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, designed to detect high-value "Whale" anomalies using Unsupervised Machine Learning.

**Tech:** Python, AsyncWeb3, WebSockets, Scikit-Learn, Redis, Docker, Streamlit  
**Highlights:**
- **Multi-Chain Support:** Simultaneously ingests and normalizes data from Bitcoin (UTXO via WebSockets) and Ethereum (Account-based via RPC).
- **AI-Powered:** Uses Isolation Forest algorithms to flag suspicious financial movements without pre-labeled data.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Built as decoupled microservices using Docker and Redis for high-concurrency processing.
